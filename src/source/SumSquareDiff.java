/**
 * Sum square difference
 * Problem 6
 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 * <p>
 * 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 * <p>
 * (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
 * <p>
 * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
